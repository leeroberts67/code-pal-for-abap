# Cyclomatic Complexity Check
## What is the Intent of the Check?
The Cyclomatic Complexity Check is part of the Clean Code Check Repository. The cyclomatic complexity measures the complexity of a program, a class, a form, or a module and is based on the control flow graph. It is a count for the number of linearly-independent paths through the source code.

A high value in cyclomatic complexity is an indicator that the source code is not in an acceptable readable form anymore, meaning that maintaining and extending the code can no longer be performed efficiently. In addition, the risk of introducing bugs is higher in code with high cyclomatic complexity.

## How does the check work?
In this implementation, the number of binary decision points "b" (for example, IF-statements) is counted.

The cyclomatic complexity M = b + 1

## Which attributes can be maintained?

## How to solve the issue?
Modularize the functionality into smaller blocks. This reduces the cyclomatic complexity and increases the readability of the code.

## What to do in case of exception?
You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC CI_CYCLO`. The pseudo comment must be placed after the `ENDMETHOD` statement.

### Example
```abap
METHOD method_name.
  " Method content
ENDMETHOD. "#EC CI_CYCLO
```
